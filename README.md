# Adoption

This repository will maintain the process forms used in OneDM's
[adoption process][].

[adoption process]: https://github.com/one-data-model/processes/blob/master/adoption.md

A process form can be in one of following states, which correspond to the
subdirectories of this repo:

* under-review

  The model has been submitted and is under review by the review
  board.

* in-last-call

  The review board has completed its processing and is asking for
  community comments.

* adopted

  The model is adopted as a OneDM model; the process form is
  maintained to document the process leading to this state.

* retired

  The submission has been retired (possibly after submitting related
  models, which should be mentioned on the retired process form).
